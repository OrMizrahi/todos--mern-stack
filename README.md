1. clone the project
2. run "npm i" from root folder to install server dependencies
3. run "npm i" from client folder to install client dependencies
4. run "npm run dev" from root folder

SIDE NOTE- i added the .env file in the server folder, so you can connect to the Database. in a real project, i would have put the .env on .gitignore
